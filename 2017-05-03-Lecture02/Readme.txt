2017-05-03-Lecture02: Supplementary material for the lecture focus on "Tissue 
Optics - Monte Carlo Modeling of light transport in turbid media", held as
part of the lecture on "Computational Photonics" at Leibniz University 
Hannover during Summer term 2017

1. Content:

L2: Monte Carlo (MC) Basics 
  2.1 - The Monte Carlo method 
  2.2 - Paradigmatic MC simulations
      2.2.1 - Estimating pi (acceptance-rejection method)
      2.2.2 - The 1D random walk
            2.2.2.1 - Simulation of discrete symmetric 1D rando walks
            2.2.2.2 - Endpoint distribution
            2.2.2.3 - The 1D RW as  limiting case
      2.2.3 - The 3D random walk
            2.2.3.1 - The "isotropic" 3D RW - easy special case
            2.2.3.2 - The "non-isotropic" 3D RW - tricky general case
